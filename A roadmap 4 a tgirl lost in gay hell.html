            <h1>A roadmap 4 a tgirl lost in gay hell</h1>
            <h2>by Ita Segev</h2>
    
            <p>You will know before you’re ready to admit it.<br> 
            Before that something in your bones will dare articulating. <br>
            Before you buy a purse & wear a non ironic skirt & take a weapon to the streets with you.<br>
            When the silent war is in your bedroom. <br>
            When his gaze will start to feel like the opposite of home.<br>
            Or like the parts of home you fled from. <br>
            When you find yourself apologizing for existing.<br>
            Or when you don’t, and he gets embarrassed -<br>
            In that way that white gay Americans get embarrassesd by transfemininity <br>
            (like unwanted weeds growing between the cracks of their parents suburban driveway,<br>
            like the parts of themselves they had to leave in closets to equally become white men).<br>
            In one of those cases you will crack,<br>
            you will grow,<br>
            you will know,<br>
            that he is not worth it.<br>
            That no ‘he’ is worth it, in fact. <br>
            ‘it’ being your roadmap towards yourself. <br>
            And at first you might feel rage for all the hes who tried to destroy this precious roadmap. <br>
            For all the shes that taught you that rage belongs to men.<br>
            That making space for the rage of men is the roadmap.<br>
            There will be so many toxic lessons that need to be undone. <br>
            And it will be hard to learn while running.<br>
            To take some good memories while breaking free from the bad.<br>
            Because if you think that gay divorce is complicated, try simultaniusly divorcing gayness (when perhapas the only place lonelier for a girl than a gay bar is the world of trans fearful & fetshizing men). <br>
            But this has never been about men, oh no.<br>
            This has always been about the parts of you that can’t be touched by them.<br>
            That make you not be part of them.<br>
            This has always been about the one relationship that might get so lonely, but will always be worth fighting for -<br>
            This has always been about you. <br>
            About the undeniable quality of light that is you.<br>
            That you get to claim,<br>
            and reclaim,<br>
            and will accompany you,<br>
            for the rest of your life.</p>
