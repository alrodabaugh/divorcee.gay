        <h3>This Is</h3>

        <p>I keep thinking<br>
        because this is not the same<br>
        I should not leave</p>
        
        <p>Because I am not my mother<br>
        asking me if we should run,<br>
        knowing she cannot stop her 4-year-old<br>
        from calling Daddy monster,<br>
        leaving a note of a covert<br>
        operation robbed of choice<br>
        this is different</p>
        
        <p>this is not abuse</p>
        
        <p>But when I tell you<br>
        I will go back to burial<br>
        I will use my mouth<br>
        to wipe myself out<br>
        I will be the hollowed eyes<br>
        of every doll I’ve ever lost<br>
        and ask you<br>
        to embody my discomfort<br>
        to step through<br>
        a curtain you never knew<br>
        you were behind<br>
        to walk wide open with me<br>
        and instead<br>
        you hold the pipe<br>
        and the shame<br>
        and the fear<br>
        and how you are still being wronged<br>
        at your chest<br>
        between us<br>
        maybe this is not different</p>
        
        <p>If safety<br>
        becomes having to<br>
        ask for a new home,<br>
        if I have to pray for<br>
        currency to keep it,<br>
        if I have to run to Harlem<br>
        to partisan a basement<br>
        or room with my grandfather’s ghost<br>
        or sleep on a friend’s couch<br>
        even though they’ve<br>
        offered me a bed<br>
        I don’t feel<br>
        I have the right to sleep in,<br>
        this is the same</p><br>
        

        <h3>moving day</h3>
        
        <p>the day<br>
        i went <br>
        to gather<br>
        the rest<br>
        of me<br>
        i knew <br>
        i would wake<br>
        up to rain<br>
        an earth <br>
        cleansed <br>
        with tears<br>
        and thunder<br>
        prepared to fully<br>
        pull me out<br>
        of the woman<br>
        i lived in</p>
        
        <p>with eyes closed<br>
        we yelled<br>
        what we <br>
        will never say<br>
        in a dream<br>
        the safest place<br>
        for the wrecking ball<br>
        of our words</p>
        
        <p>you appeared<br>
        a white woman<br>
        in a home<br>
        that was <br>
        never mine<br>
        standing <br>
        in the clutter<br>
        with privilege<br>
        corroding<br>
        at your chest</p>
        
        <p>my things<br>
        are only <br>
        a corner<br>
        stuffed in bags<br>
        and boxes<br>
        ripe with escape</p>
        
        <p>money is a prison<br>
        and i am<br>
        leaving with <br>
        one small<br>
        cell<br>
        in a thin<br>
        slither <br>
        of promising<br>
        light</p>
        
        <p>if we <br>
        were back<br>
        to back <br>
        in this <br>
        silent duel<br>
        an aged <br>
        wilted love<br>
        pressed <br>
        spine to spine<br>
        the bullets<br>
        in our <br>
        guns <br>
        would be <br>
        a wounding<br>
        goodbye</p>
