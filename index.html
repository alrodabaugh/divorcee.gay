    <h1>INFO</h1>
    <p>The Gay Divorcees is a band of real-life queers who got gay married and gay divorced, led by composer Ethan Philbrick, who came together during a pandemic to write songs about getting into and out of state-sanctioned intimacy in the 21st century.</p>

    <p>Throughout February 2021, The Gay Divorcees streamed their album of songs over the toll-free number 1-855-GAY-DIVO. On Sunday, February 14th, they teamed up with the One Archives at USC to present a remote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31hF87TbE88">Valentine’s Day listening party</a> filled with performances, readings, and other surprises. On Thursday, February 25th, a group of queer theorists offered responses to the project in an <a href="https://vimeo.com/521056868">online event hosted by the Department of Performance Studies at NYU.</a></p>

    <p>In a moment when many people are trying to figure out how to get out of situations that are no longer working or keep going after the end of something, The Gay Divorcees approach their experience with marriage and divorce as potentially instructive. Divorce your old patterns! Divorce your broken political systems! Divorce your inherited ideologies!</p>

Around this are eight images: Ethan Philbrick lounging on the floor, Ita Segev against a white background, Ashton Young with a painting behind them that says “and I begin again,” Paul Legault outside, Julia Steinmetz against a green background, Robbie Acklen posing in a robe with a hammer, Lauren Denitzio with a dog, and Lauren Bakst against a brick background. In otherwise still images, the mouths of the members of the band are oscillating between smiling and frowning on an infinite loop.</p>
